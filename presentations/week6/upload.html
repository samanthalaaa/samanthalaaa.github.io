<p>
    I used <a href="http://www.kupfertandkim.com/">Kupfert & Kim's</a> website as inspiration for this wireframe. As you can see on their website they use paralax scrolling to display the photos in an exciting way. This website would also use paralax scrolling. The siderbar would be stationary while scrolling through the site, so what appears at the top of the sidebar in the wireframe would always stay in that place. The sidebar would also be translucent so you could still see the photos behind it. I would use very clean sans-serif fonts - similar to the one used by Kupfert & Kim - for both the headings and body. I would use mostly black and white, with the pops of colour appearing in the photos of the food. The photos would all be of the food, they would be very bright, minimalist and colourful to convey a clean, light and airy feeling. I would not use a background (just keep it white), to help keep it light.
